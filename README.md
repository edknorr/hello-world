# hello-world
I'm following the tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/
I've created a branch called readme-edit, which is a copy of the repository.  So, I now have two versions that I can work on, in parallel, or as required.  At some point in the future, I may wish to merge (roll together) the two versions into the master version (the master branch).
26 / 13 = 2
17 * 11 = 187
